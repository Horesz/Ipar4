## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details

The application consists of two main components:
1. **FaceDetector class**: Handles face detection and facial landmark estimation
2. **VirtualAccessoryApp class**: Manages the user interface, accessories overlay, and user interaction

### Face Detection

The face detection system uses OpenCV's Haar cascade classifiers to identify facial features:
- Frontal face detection
- Eye detection
- Estimation of mouth, nose, and head top position

### Accessory Overlay

Accessories are PNG images with alpha channel transparency that are:
- Automatically resized based on face dimensions
- Positioned according to facial feature locations
- Customizable through user controls

## üì∑ Sample Accessories

The application comes with sample accessories:
- Basic hat
- Sunglasses
- Mustache

You can add your own custom accessories by placing PNG files with transparency in the 'accessories' folder.

## üîß Customization

### Adding New Accessories

1. Create a PNG image with transparent background
2. Add the file to the 'accessories' folder
3. The application will automatically detect and categorize it based on the filename

### Supported Filenames for Auto-Categorization

- **Headwear**: *hat.png*, *cap.png*, *crown.png*, *santa_hat.png*
- **Glasses**: *sunglasses.png*, *nerd_glasses.png*, *party_glasses.png*
- **Facial Hair**: *mustache1.png*, *beard.png*, *goatee.png*
